Bruce Wayne! Design, live and breathe. What brings you out of the prior sleep, Mr. Wayne?

The city needs Bruce Wayne, your resources, your knowledge. It doesn't need your body or your life. That time is past.

I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you... stranger.

Just you, sir? Don't worry, Master Wayne. It takes a little time to get back in the swing of things.

Yes. The fire rises.

I told you I was immortal. Oh there are many forms of immortality.

Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate of fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You're skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us Mr. Wayne, what do you fear?

There you are! There is nothing to fear but fear itseIf!

Didn't you get the memo?
